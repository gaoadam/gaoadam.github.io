<h2>I am working on a industrial tech business</h2>

  <p>I'm currently validating a business idea to help manufacturing companies collect and aggregate operational data for defect and failure prevention.</p>

  <p>Once I've aggregated some feedback from operational experts I've been interviewing, I will post a general playbook and offering description on here. All you need to know for now is that it begins with a low latency data collection solution. I will elaborate in the future.</p>

  <p>Currently, this website is just my personal project portfolio. A number of years ago I made some Python scripts to teach myself neural networks and make physics simulations using Pytorch and Nvidia's CUDA support to run them on my GPU.</p>

<h2> About Me </h2>

  <p>After graduating with a BS in physics from the University of Toronto, I worked as a data scientist for a buildings management startup, and then a technical consulting firm.</p>

  <p> I have other hobbies too. </p>
  
  <p>My music can be found on my <a href="https://adamgao.bandcamp.com">bandcamp</a>. My <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@adamgaosignals">youtube channel</a> mainly consists of physics simulations and finished songs.</p>
