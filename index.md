<h2>Welcome!</h2>

  <p>I'm currently validating a business idea to help manufacturing companies collect and aggregate operational data for defect and failiure prevention.</p>

  <p>After graduating with a BS in physics from the University of Toronto, I worked as a data scientist for a buildings management startup, and then a technical consulting firm.</p>

  <p>This website is currently my personal project portfolio. Currently it's some Python scripts I made to teach myself neural networks a number of years ago. They involve physics simulations and signal processing.</p>

  <p> I have other hobbies too. </p>
  
  <p>My music can be found on my <a href="https://adamgao.bandcamp.com">bandcamp</a>. My <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@adamgaosignals">youtube channel</a> mainly consists of physics simulations and finished songs.</p>

  <p>You can contact me via email: <a href="mailto:hello.adam.gao@gmail.com">hello.adam.gao@gmail.com</a></p>
